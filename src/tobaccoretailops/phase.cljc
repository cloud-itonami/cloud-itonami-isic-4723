  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-4723 specialized tobacco retail
  operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only            -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging     -- sales-record logging allowed, every
                                     write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination-- adds staffing-operation scheduling
                                     and supply-order proposals, still
                                     approval-gated.
    Phase 3  supervised auto      -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                     `:log-sales-record`/
                                     `:schedule-staffing-operation`/
                                     `:coordinate-supply-order` may
                                     auto-commit. `:flag-compliance-concern`
                                     NEVER auto-commits, at any phase,
                                     and a high-cost `:coordinate-supply-order`
                                     still escalates even at phase 3 (the
                                     governor's own `high-stakes?` keeps
                                     it out of `:commit`).

  `:flag-compliance-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Flagging a compliance concern (a
  suspected age-verification failure or regulatory concern) always needs
  a human to actually look at it -- this op never itself finalizes an
  age-verification decision. `tobaccoretailops.governor`'s own
  `always-escalate-ops` enforces the same invariant independently -- two
  layers, not one, agree on this."
